# prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Problem Statement
# You can buy on the same day and sell on the day 
# Again you can buy and sell on the day to get the maximum profit
#
# for the given example, we can buy on index 1 and sell on index 2. Which is 5 -1 = 4
# then we can buy on index 3 and sell on index 4. Which is 6 - 3 = 3
# max profit will be 4 + 3 = 7
